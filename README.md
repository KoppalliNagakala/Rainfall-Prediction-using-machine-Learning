# Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

This project, "Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning," is a basic machine learning model designed to predict rainfall using meteorological data. The Jupyter Notebook (`Rainfall Prediction using machine Learning.ipynb`) covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of predictive models. It utilizes popular machine learning techniques and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. The goal is to train and evaluate models to determine which algorithm best predicts rainfall patterns, aiding in better weather forecasting and planning.
